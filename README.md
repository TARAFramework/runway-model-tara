This is a model of [TARA](https://github.com/TARAFramework/docs/blob/master/TARA.pdf) for [Runway](https://runway.systems). It includes a `.model` file describing the state and how it changes, as well as a `.js` file which can be used with [runway-browser] (https://github.com/salesforce/runway-browser) to produce an interactive visualization.

The model you find in this repo is an early draft and may not be correct. This specification of TARA is for visual purposes of understanding only & not a final specification; if there is such a thing, it's [TARA.tla](https://github.com/TARAFramework/tara.tla).
